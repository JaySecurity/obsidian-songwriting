[Verse 1]
Cadd9 G Cadd9 G    Cadd9                     G
               She left without leaving a number
          Cadd9                   G
Said, she needed to clear her mind
   Cadd9             D        Em
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
                  Cadd9                D
'Cause she talked about it all the time
G                Cadd9
 It was almost a year 
       D
Before she called him up
G                   Cadd9
 Three rings and an answering machine
D
 Is what she got
 
 
[Chorus]
          G                     Em
If you're calling 'bout the car,  I sold it
Cadd9                        D
     If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
Em                               D
  If you've got something to sell
                    Cadd9         D
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
        G            Am               G                     Cadd9
If it's anybody else,  wait for the tone You know what to do
Am        F            D
  And P.S. if this is Austin
 
 
[Break]
        Cadd9   G
I still love you
 
 
[Verse 2]
Cadd9 G    Cadd9                    G
       The telephone fell to the counter
         Cadd9                        G
She heard     but she couldn't believe
Cadd9             D         Em
     What kind of man would hang on that long
Cadd9                            D
     What kind of love that must be
G                 Cadd9
 She waited three days 
           D
And then she tried again
G                           Cadd9
 She didn't know what she'd say  
        D
But she heard three rings and then
 
 
[Chorus]
        G                  Em
If it's Friday night I'm at  the ballgame
    Cadd9                D
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
Em                          D
  I'm headed out to the lake
              Cadd9            D
And I'll be gone,  all weekend long
         G                   Am
But I'll call you back when I  get home
   G               Cadd9
On Sunday afternoon
Am        F            D
  And P.S. if this is Austin
        G
I still love you
 
 
[Bridge]
      Am
Well, this time she left her number
    Em
But not another word
         D#
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
Dsus4                    D
     And this is what he heard
 
 
[Chorus]
          A                      F#m
If you're calling 'bout my heart,   it's still yours
D                       E
 I should've listened to it a little more
F#m                        E           D
   Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
              E
To know where I belong
     A             Bm
And by the way, boy
                A                   D
This is no machine you're talking to
Bm               G         Esus4 E
  Can't you tell, this is Austin
 
 
[Outro]
      D             A
And I still love you
D A        D       A D A
   I still love you
