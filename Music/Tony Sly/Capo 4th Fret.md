## Song

```chords

[Intro]
D    Dsus2    Dsus4     D
Em9    Em7    Em7*     Em9
G                   Asus4      A
 
[Verse 1]
       D           A          Bm
Like a child I can sit in the corner
           G           D          A
with these pills I can barely get by
     D            A          Bm
so I wait for the hour of approval
    G         A        D
ten minutes until it's five
 
         D            A             Bm
And it's Friday, so I don't feel so lonely
           G          D     A
I know the wolves are out tonight
    D        A        Bm
the sound of ice in a bottomless glass
      G       A           D
tells me that all that is fine
 
[Chorus]
Bm                     G
Playing guitar and I'm forgetting words
       D                        A
like a baby who just learned to speak
Bm                      G
unfinished songs that I swear I'd get done
        D                        A
but the premise was just kind of weak
 
[Verse 2]
         D            A             Bm
Like the moon you are cold, you are distant
         G         D                A
like the sun I can burn through the day
       D          A         Bm
in the valley the echo gets longer
        G   A    D
they've all gone away
 
[Chorus]
Bm                     G
Playing guitar and I'm forgetting words
       D                        A
like a baby who just learned to speak
Bm                      G
unfinished songs that I swear I'd get done
        D                        A
but the premise was just kind of weak
 
[Interlude]
D    Dsus2    Dsus4     D
Em9    Em7    Em7*     Em9
G                   Asus4      A
 
[softly]
         D           A       Bm
There is time to reflect and ponder
       G          D          A
as the chips fall where they may
       D            A       Bm
I will live for the sake of others
   G        A      D
so they can do the same
